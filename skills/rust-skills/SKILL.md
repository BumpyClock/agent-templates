# Rust guidance

Use the repository's Rust edition, MSRV, libraries, and conventions.
Read only rule files relevant to the current decision.
Treat rule summaries as guidance with constraints, not automatic refactor requirements.
Preserve unsafe-code invariants, safety comments, and public API contracts.
Measure performance before changes to optimization settings or data structures.

## Select a category

Locate matching files under `rules/` by prefix.
Use [the full catalog](RULES.md) only when you need summaries to select a rule.

| Decision | Prefixes |
| --- | --- |
| Ownership or allocation | `own-`, `mem-` |
| Error propagation | `err-` |
| Unsafe code or FFI | `unsafe-` |
| Public APIs, types, or traits | `api-`, `type-`, `trait-` |
| Async or concurrent work | `async-`, `conc-` |
| Numeric operations or conversions | `num-`, `conv-` |
| Compile-time expressions | `const-` |
| Serialization | `serde-` |
| Patterns, macros, or callbacks | `pat-`, `macro-`, `closure-` |
| Collections | `coll-` |
| Names, documentation, or diagnostics | `name-`, `doc-`, `obs-` |
| Performance or compiler optimization | `perf-`, `opt-` |
| Project layout or lints | `proj-`, `lint-` |
| Tests | `test-` |
| Suspected anti-pattern | `anti-` |

## Validation

Select tests through [test quality](../programming/references/write-tests.md).
Use [TDD](../programming/references/tdd-rules.md) only when the user or repository requires it.
Read `test-` rules for Rust-specific mechanics after test selection.
Reuse applicable evidence through [verification](../programming/references/verification-before-completion.md).
